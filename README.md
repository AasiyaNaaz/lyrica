## 🚀 Features

### 1. Learn Structures with Music
**Concept:** Gamified learning of building and construction structures using music and interactive visuals.  
**Core Idea:** Each level teaches a structural concept (bridges, walls, arches, beams, natural frequencies, stacking methods) using **sound and interactivity**.

**Key Features:**

#### 🌌 Level Map (Galaxy/Space Map)
- Vertical scroll with cinematic glowing levels.  
- Zig-zag layout with pulsating, shining level nodes.  
- Levels light up as the player progresses.  
- UFO or thematic icon moves along the path with trailing particles.  
- Stars indicate “completion rating” or mastery of each concept.  

#### 🛠 Interactive Level Content
- Each level explains a structural concept interactively.  
- **Music Integration:** Notes and frequencies represent structural properties.  
  - Example: Stacking stones vs. wood side by side produces different sounds, visualizing natural frequency.  
- **Mini-games / Experiments:** Tap or drag elements to test structural stability. Music dynamically changes based on resonance.  

#### ✨ Visual & UX Elements
- Twinkling stars, glowing paths, animated UFO indicators.  
- Cinematic particle trails for an “extravagant” effect.  
- Help and back buttons for easy navigation.

#### 🎮 Gamification
- Earn stars based on interaction, accuracy, or completion.  
- Unlock levels progressively.  
- Fun feedback through music and visuals.


### 2. Flutter Music Cipher Game (Cryptography Module)
A **fun and educational module** teaching cryptography through music. Users input melodies or text, encrypt messages using **confusion and diffusion**, and decrypt puzzles with audio-visual aids.

**Features:**

#### 📖 Multi-slide Learn Module
- Explains confusion and diffusion in cryptography.  
- Play sample melodies: plain, confusion-encrypted, diffusion-encrypted, and fully encrypted music.

#### 🎹 Try It Out Module
- Enter messages as text or build melodies note-by-note.  
- Control encryption parameters: confusion key, number of rounds, diffusion strength.  
- Play original and encrypted melodies with real-time piano-roll visualization.

#### 🧩 Decode Module
- Solve puzzles by decrypting encrypted melodies using keys and rounds knowledge.  
- Earn coins for correct solutions; use hints at a cost.  
- Audio playback with synchronized piano-roll animation.

#### ✨ Rich UI with Animations
- Smooth navigation, elegant gradients, and engaging audio-visual interaction.


### 3. Data Structures through Music
**Concept:** Learn abstract data structures by translating them into musical analogies.  
**Structures Covered:** Trees, stacks, linked lists, merging arrays, sorting.

**Features:**
- Each structure represented with **musical notes or sequences**.  
- Operations (insert, delete, merge, sort) represented as **playable musical patterns**.  
- Interactive mini-games allow users to manipulate data and **hear the effect**.  
- Reinforces memory by associating **visual + audio + logic**.


## 🎮 How It Works
1. **Learn:** Explore concepts through **music & visuals**.  
2. **Try It Out:** Build melodies, encrypt messages, or experiment with structures.  
3. **Decode / Play:** Solve puzzles, earn rewards, and reinforce concepts.
